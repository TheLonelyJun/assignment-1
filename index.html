        <h1>What am I Intrested In?</h1>
        <p>I have many things I am intrested in but I will only talk about three of them.</p>
        <h1>Video Games</h1>
	<p>Video games are electronic game that you can play on certain devices. (Example: pc, xbox, ps4, etc.)
	I love playing video games becuase of all the experience you can get by playing them. Some games can teach you
	to handle high stress situations for example Elden Ring teaches you to stay calm, take your time, and make you 
	learn the habits of your opponent. Other games I like is Rainbow six siege (R6). R6 is a fps (First-Person-Shooter)
	I like playing R6 because you can pick operators that have certain gadgets and guns to use and by using those 
	tools in your hand to win games against other people online is satisfying to me.</p>
	<h1>Basketball</h1>
	<p>At first I didn't like basketball much due to how unskilled I was with the ball, it made me frustrated but 
	my father liked the sport so I would get involved in playing basketball anyways. I started liking basketball 
	when I watched a movie called Coach Carter. Due to that movie I kept on practicing my basketball skills to get
	better and most importantly have fun. Most of my experience playing basketball is playing one on one with a friend 
	or my brother. My most favorite memory though was winning a bronze medal on the senior team in my middle school 
	the first and one time I was on a basketball team.</p>
	<h1>Computer Programming</h1>
	<p>The reason why I start computer programming was because it had to do something with computers. I started coding 
	with scratch in middle school. Scratch made me intrested in doing comp sci due to the fact of how intresting it is 
	to be able to make games through coding. So I decided to take the three high school programs on comp sci in high 
	school. In the first year I did scratch yet again and learn binary. In the second year I learned how to use Java 
	and made some programs with instructions. I made a guessing game were you had to guess a number and base on your 
	input it would tell you higher or lower until you get the right answer. In my third year I had to make programs 
	with no further instructions and I also coded with a breadboard. Now I am here learning coding still and I still 
	find comp sci intresting.</p>
