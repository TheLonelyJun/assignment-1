        <h1>What am I Intrested In?</h1>
        <p>I have many things I am intrested in but I will only talk about three of them.</p>
        <h1>Video Games</h1>
	<p>Video games are electronic game that you can play on certain devices. (Example: pc, xbox, ps4, etc.)
	I love playing video games becuase of all the experience you can get by playing them. Some games can teach you
	to handle high stress situations for example Elden Ring teaches you to stay calm, take your time, and make you 
	learn the habits of your opponent. Other games I like is Rainbow six siege (R6). R6 is a fps (First-Person-Shooter)
	I like playing R6 because you can pick operators that have certain gadgets and guns to use and by using those 
	tools in your hand to win games against other people online is satisfying to me.</p>
