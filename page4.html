        <h3>Biography</h3>
         <p>Mona is my sweet little weirdo – she is about 6 years old now. At first glance, she seems
	like a tough cat to love: always on edge, anxious, shy, and seems to not like being touched.
	But she just takes some time to warm up, and once she does, she will jump up on your desk
	and rub against you for hours, not leaving until you give her just the right amount of
	attention.
	</p>
         <p>She is extremely talkative, always meowing wherever she goes. She’s also a bit of a brat
	when it comes to the litter box – imagine not flushing the toilet, that’s her! Her name is
	actually based on the cat Morgana from Persona 5, a game my girlfriend at the time and I
	were playing together. It was her idea to name Mona, and it stuck!
	</p>		
         <p>Despite her being a bit of a brat, she’s always been there for me, and I look forward to
	having her be a little pest for the years to come!</p>
